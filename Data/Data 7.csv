Only results with an uncorrected P-value<0.05 and at least 3 CpG sites within the DMR were included.,,,,,,,,
Gene symbols annotated using Ensembl release 75.,,,,,,,,
Arrows indicate direction of DNA methylation change in relation to case subjects (bipolar disorder or bipolar disorder suicide subjects). ,,,,,,,,
Results are sorted by P-value. ,,,,,,,,
"The flagged column annotates differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with a multi-modal distribution of DNA methylation; 1 confirms the presence of the pattern, 0 confirms the absence of the pattern.",,,,,,,,
