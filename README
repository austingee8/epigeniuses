This github provides the Juptyer Notebook used to process the data for the epigeniuses team.

The folder CpGFinder contains our 8-state Markov Model, testing data using the referenced TNXB gene,
and a notebook file with additional commentary and presentation of algorithms.

The notebook provides a structure to pull important data from various excel documents and find 
similarities between excel documents. The notebook also provides a way to print out the data in 
a way that is easy to communicate with biologists. Finally, the notebook also creates files to 
be used as inputs to an online venn diagram creator (link provided in notebook) so that the 
outputs can be visualized.

The notebook was made with the purpose to be easily modifiable so that new or different data 
can easily be incorporated. It also allows for the existing data to be used in different ways,
accessing different values of the excel sheet as needed.

The data used for our paper is also included in this repository as a reference. The different
data and what mental disorder it pertains to is as follows:
"Data 1.csv" - Depression
"Data 2.csv" - Schizophrenia
"Data 3.csv" - Schizophrenia
"Data 4.csv" - Schizophrenia
"Data 5.csv" - Bipolar/Depression
"Data 6.csv" - Bipolar/Depression
"Data 7.csv" - Bipolar/Depression
"Data 8.csv" - Childhood Stress
"Data 9.csv" - Childhood Stress
"Data 10.csv" - Alcoholism
